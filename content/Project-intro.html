    Introduction to this textbook editor</h1><p>Welcome to the OERPUB project and TextBook Editor! </p><p style="">This is an alpha version and will be improving and changing over the next couple of months. If you are here, you have probably figured out that you have to use Chrome for right now. Firefox is coming soon. We aren't purposely doing anything browser-specific, so eventually this editor will work in all modern browsers.</p><p style="">Click on the book chapters to see real content and play with the editor. Be sure and add some mathematics, and some textbook semantic blocks (Note to Reader, Activity, etc.) Images encourage authors to add descriptive alternate text for learners with visual impairments and provide lots of opportunity to properly source the image.</p><p style="">To start your own book, click "Fork this Book" (copy) <a href="http://editor.oerpub.org/#repo/oerpub/empty-book" class="" title="">the empty-book</a>. <br /></p><h2 id="3e8f48ac-324e-a222-11b0-57ac7b92f33d">Find out more </h2><p>See <strong>About the Textbook Editor</strong> in the Book Picker</p><p><br /></p></body>
